BINARY SEARCH FORMAT INTRODUCTION:

Binary search is a little different than other algorithms we have covered because it can be applied to a large variety of problems, and the implementation of each could vary quite a bit. For instance, you can use a binary search to find the square root of a number, to determine if a list contains a specific number, or to determine which git commit caused a bug in your code (git bisect does this).

To help with this, I have selected practice problems that each illustrate a unique way that a binary search can be used. I definitely recommend checking out all of them , even if you feel you understand binary search; chances are you will learn at least one new way to apply the algorithm.

What is binary search?
In itâ€™s simplest form, binary search is an algorithm used to search for an item in a sorted listed.

- Binary Search
- Order Agnostic Binary search
- 1st and last occurance of an element
- Count of element in a sorted array
- no of times an array is rotated
- find an element in rotated array
- searching in nearly sorted array
- floor and ceil of an element
- next letter
- index of last 1 in sorted array
- find the position of an element in an infinite sorted array
- min diff element in a sorted array
- Bitonic array maximum element
- Search in a bitonic array
- Search in row, col wise sorted matrix
- Find element in sorted array that appears once
- Allocate min no of pages
