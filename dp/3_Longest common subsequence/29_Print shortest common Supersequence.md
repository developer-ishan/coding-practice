Given two strings X and Y, print the shortest string that has both X and Y as subsequences. If multiple shortest supersequence exists, print any one of them.

Examples:

Input: X = "AGGTAB", Y = "GXTXAYB"
Output: "AGXGTXAYB" OR "AGGXTXAYB"
OR Any string that represents shortest
supersequence of X and Y

Input: X = "HELLO", Y = "GEEK"
Output: "GEHEKLLO" OR "GHEEKLLO"
OR Any string that represents shortest
supersequence of X and Y
