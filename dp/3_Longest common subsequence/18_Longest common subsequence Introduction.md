Longest common subsequence variations

1. Longest common substring
2. Print LCS
3. Shortest common supersequence
4. Print SCS
5. Min no of insertions and deletions a--->b
6. Largest Repeating subsequence
7. Length of largest subsequence of A which is a substring in b
8. sequence pattern matching
9. Count how many times a appear as a subsequence in b
10. Largest palindromic subsequence
11. Largest Palendromic substring
12. Count of palindromic substring
13. Min no of deletion in a string to make it a palindrome
14. Min no of insertions in a string to make a palindrome

Longest Common Subsequence Problem solution using recursion
Given two sequences, find the length of longest subsequence present in both of them.
A subsequence is a sequence that appears in the same relative order, but not necessarily contiguous.

For example, “abc”, “abg”, “bdf”, “aeg”, ‘”acefg”, .. etc are subsequences of “abcdefg”.
