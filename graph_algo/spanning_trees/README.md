# Spannign Trees
A spanning tree of an undirected graph G is a subgraph that is a tree which includes all of the vertices of G.

If we have a graph containing V vertices and E edges, then the graph can be represented as:

G(V, E)

If we create the spanning tree from the above graph, then the spanning tree would have the same number of vertices as the graph, but the vertices are not equal. The edges in the spanning tree would be equal to the number of edges in the graph minus 1.
